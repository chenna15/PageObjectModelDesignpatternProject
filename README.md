 Page Object Model is an Design Pattern in Automating Web Applicatiions
Imagine you have a website with different pages, like a login page, a home page, and a profile page. 
Each of these pages has elements like text boxes, buttons, and links that you interact with during testing.

With POM, you create a separate "page object" for each of these pages. Each page object contains code that describes how to interact with the elements on that page.
So, instead of writing the same code to find and interact with elements on multiple pages in every test, you write it once in the page object for that page.

 Here we can divide operational methods in one class and object element identification methods in one class
